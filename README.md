# Credit Card Detection
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle containing credit card transaction records. The dataset provides a collection of features associated with each transaction, including transaction amount, time, and various anonymized features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at the following link: Credit Card Fraud Dataset. It contains a large number of credit card transaction records, both fraudulent and legitimate, and serves as the basis for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

• data/: This directory contains the dataset files, including the CSV file with credit card transaction records. The dataset is not included in the repository and needs to be downloaded separately from the provided Kaggle link.

• notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks are named accordingly to indicate their purpose.

• src/: This directory contains the source code for the credit card fraud detection system. It includes modules for data preprocessing, • • feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

• models/: This directory stores the trained machine learning models. They can be used for making predictions on new credit card transactions.

• README.md: The readme file you are currently reading provides an overview of the project, dataset, and project structure.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1- Download the credit card fraud dataset from the Kaggle link provided.

2- Place the downloaded dataset CSV file in the data/ directory.

3- Install the necessary dependencies and libraries specified in the project's requirements file.

4- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the data, preprocess it, and train models for fraud detection.

5- Use the provided source code in the src/ directory to implement and customize the fraud detection system.

6- If desired, train and evaluate different machine learning models using the notebooks and source code.

7- Make predictions on new credit card transactions using the trained models stored in the models/ directory.
